7. **Features**: Key Features:
Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for building and training a CNN for image classification.
Implements data augmentation and preprocessing using ImageDataGenerator.
Visualizes random images and model performance metrics.
Integrates error handling for power monitoring and unit testing for data processing functions.
This setup is designed for image classification tasks with structured data directories and includes essential functionalities for model development, training, evaluation, and testing. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and environments.

Problem 
"The train_model function is designed to train a neural network model using the Keras fit_generator method, which is suitable for training with data generators."
this took up a substantial time of the program, to combat this we reduced the total number of epochs from 30 to 10"
Done by Iyinoluwa,Samson,Norton
This was done by using our judgment to find a number which strikes a balance between a high good reliable number for results but also low enough to improve run time meaningfully.
We went on CodeCarbon and PowerApi and with the help of AI integrated it into our code,unsuccessfully however
