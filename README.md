Problem 
"The train_model function is designed to train a neural network model using the Keras fit_generator method, which is suitable for training with data generators."
this took up a substantial time of the program, to combat this we reduced the total number of epochs from 30 to 10"
Done by Iyinoluwa,Samson,Norton
This was done by using our judgment to find a number which strikes a balance between a high good reliable number for results but also low enough to improve run time meaningfully
