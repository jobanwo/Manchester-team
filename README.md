Problem 
"The train_model function is designed to train a neural network model using the Keras fit_generator method, which is suitable for training with data generators."
this took up a substantial time of the program, to combat this we reduced the total number of epochs from 30 to 10"
This was done by using our judgment to find a number which strikes a balance between a high good reliable number for results but also low enough to improve run time meaningfully
Attempted to Use PowerAPI and Code Carbon to measure and collate CO2 emissions levels based on energy consumptions data. Could not intergrate correctly and get the code to run
